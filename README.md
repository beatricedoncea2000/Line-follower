#### Task
We had a line follower kit with a QTR-8A sensor and also the lower body of the line follower, by default the robot is a car. We used 6 sensors out of 8. This robot should follow straight lines, curved lines, all in a route and the calibration should be implemented with automatic motor movement. The final course should be done within 35 seconds. The optimal finishing time should be 20 seconds. Regarding the code, firstly we had to implement the automatic calibration of the robot, then we had to implement PID, in our case the PD.<br>
